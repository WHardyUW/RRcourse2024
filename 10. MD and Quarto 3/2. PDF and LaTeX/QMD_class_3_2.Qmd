## PDF

PDFs are created using LaTeX. As such some 'dynamic' fields don't work here. But also, we get to use TeX for formatting. 

### PDF-specifc options

Changing the font size:

`fontsize: 11pt`

Changing the margins: 

`geometry: margin=1in`

(These actually modify LaTeX template options).

---

### LaTeX-related

We can set the document type.

`documentclass: article` 

(alternatives include `letter`, `book`, `slides`, `beamer`, etc.)

---

We can change the engine used to produce the output, e.g.:

`  pdf:`  
`    latex_engine: xelatex`

---

We can tell RMarkdown to keep the intermediate `.tex` file.

`  pdf:`  
`    keep_tex: true`

(Note: similarly, we can keep the `.md` file for non-pdf formats with `keep_md: true`)

---

We can use `LaTeX` directly within the document and it will be processed using the chosen engine.

`\newpage  `  
`\Large Large letters`

\end{center}
\newpage  
\Large Large letters
\footnote{This is a footnote}

---

You may also use the LaTeX citation syntax. We need to specify what package do we want to use to manage the citations, e.g.:

`pdf_document:`  
`    citation_package: natbib`

#### QMD

`Studies concerning other cultural goods exploit quasi-natural experiments of policy and institutional changes. One example of the policy change is the introduction of download penalization in France (HADOPI), as scrutinized by @danaher_effect_2012. The analyzed cases of institutional change include the sudden and transitory disappearance of the NBC content from iTunes [@danaher_converting_2010] as well as the Megaupload shutdown [@danaher_gone_2014; @peukert_piracy_2013] and website blocking in the UK [@danaher_website_2016]. Interestingly, @danaher_gone_2014 and @peukert_piracy_2013 analyzing the same case of Megaupload shutdown come to rather different conclusions: the former find that the shutdown caused an increase in digital downloads from legal sources; the latter finds no change in box office revenue. This difference could be attributed to the fact that a downloaded "pirated" copy may be a perfect substitute for a copy downloaded from a legitimate source, but not for a visit to the movie theater. @danaher_website_2016 argue that only large scale interventions (such as blocking multiple websites with unauthorized distribution) appear noticeably reduce "piracy" and raise paid consumption, but these effects are only transitory.`
