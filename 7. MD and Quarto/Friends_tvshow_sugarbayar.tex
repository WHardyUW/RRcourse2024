Friends is an American television sitcom created by \emph{David Crane}
and \emph{Marta Kauffman}, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994,
to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons.With an ensemble cast starring
\emph{Jennifer Aniston}, \emph{Courteney Cox}, \emph{Lisa Kudrow},
\emph{Matt LeBlanc}, \emph{Matthew Perry} and \emph{David Schwimmer},
the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and early 30s who live
in Manhattan, New York City. The original executive producers were
\emph{Kevin S. Bright}, \emph{Kauffman}, and \emph{Crane}.

\emph{Kauffman} and \emph{Crane} began developing Friends under the
working title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. They
presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page
treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes,
including title changes to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series
was finally named Friends. Filming took place at Warner Bros.~Studios in
Burbank, California. The series was produced by \emph{Brightm Kauffman,
Crane} Productions and Warner Bros.~Television.
