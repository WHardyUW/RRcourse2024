# Meta-analysis on Toy Preferences: Parental Presence and Toy Preferences

### __(*Note:* This analysis is based on the data from Todd et al., 2017 - "Sex differences in children’s toy preferences: A systematic review, meta‐regression, and meta‐analysis")__

***

### Overview

Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for combining the findings from independent studies. It is often used to assess the effectiveness of healthcare interventions and to derive general conclusions from multiple studies on the same topic.

In this assignment, we analyze data on children's toy preferences, specifically focusing on the effect of parental presence during the study. The dataset includes mean times (in seconds) spent playing with toys, sample sizes, standard errors, and additional study characteristics.

### Data Summary

```{python}
# Calculate effect sizes for boys playing with male-typed toys
data['TE_boys_male'], data['seTE_boys_male'] = effectsize_smd(
    data['Mean_boys_play_male'], data['SD_boys_play_male'], data['N_boys'],
    data['Mean_girls_play_male'], data['SD_girls_play_male'], data['N_girls']
)
data['TE_girls_female'], data['seTE_girls_female'] = effectsize_smd(
    data['Mean_girls_play_female'], data['SD_girls_play_female'], data['N_girls'],
    data['Mean_boys_play_female'], data['SD_boys_play_female'], data['N_boys']
)

# Perform meta-analysis for boys playing with male-typed toys
res_boys_male = combine_effects(data['TE_boys_male'], data['seTE_boys_male']**2, method_re='dl')
res_girls_female = combine_effects(data['TE_girls_female'], data['seTE_girls_female']**2, method_re='dl')

res_boys_male_summary = {
    "Combined effect size (random effects)": res_boys_male.effect,
    "95% CI (random)": (res_boys_male.conf_int(alpha=0.05)[0], res_boys_male.conf_int(alpha=0.05)[1])
}

res_girls_female_summary = {
    "Combined effect size (random effects)": res_girls_female.effect,
    "95% CI (random)": (res_girls_female.conf_int(alpha=0.05)[0], res_girls_female.conf_int(alpha=0.05)[1])
}

res_boys_male_summary, res_girls_female_summary
```

### Combined Effects

#### Boys Playing with Male-typed Toys

- Number of studies combined: `r len(data)`
- Random effects model: `r res_boys_male_summary["Combined effect size (random effects)"]` [95% CI: `r res_boys_male_summary["95% CI (random)"][0]`, `r res_boys_male_summary["95% CI (random)"][1]`]

#### Girls Playing with Female-typed Toys

- Number of studies combined: `r len(data)`
- Random effects model: `r res_girls_female_summary["Combined effect size (random effects)"]` [95% CI: `r res_girls_female_summary["95% CI (random)"][0]`, `r res_girls_female_summary["95% CI (random)"][1]`]

### Bar Plot

The bar plot helps to visualize the effect sizes based on the level of parental presence.

```{python}
# Create a bar plot for boys playing with male-typed toys by parental presence
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x=data['Parent present'], y=data['TE_boys_male'], ci=None)
plt.title('Bar Plot of Boys Playing with Male-typed Toys by Parental Presence')
plt.xlabel('Parental Presence (1 = Absent, 2 = Minimal, 3 = Moderate/Full)')
plt.ylabel('Effect Size')
plt.show()
```

### Density Plot

The density plot helps to visualize the distribution of effect sizes by parental presence.

```{python}
# Create a density plot for boys playing with male-typed toys by parental presence
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.kdeplot(data=data, x='TE_boys_male', hue='Parent present', fill=True)
plt.title('Density Plot of Boys Playing with Male-typed Toys by Parental Presence')
plt.xlabel('Effect Size')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.show()
```

### Checking the Effect of Parental Presence

We analyze whether the level of parental presence affects the results using meta-regression.

```{python}
# Prepare the data for meta-regression
data['Parent_present'] = data['Parent present'].astype(float)

meta_reg_parental_presence = smf.ols('TE_boys_male ~ Parent_present', data=data).fit()
meta_reg_parental_presence.summary()
```

### Effect of Author Gender

We investigate whether the gender of the authors has any effect on the study outcomes.

```{python}
# Meta-regression to check the impact of author gender for boys playing with male-typed toys
meta_reg_gender = smf.ols('TE_boys_male ~ Q("Female authors") + Q("Male authors")', data=data).fit()
meta_reg_gender.summary()
```

### Summary

This analysis provided insights into the overall effects of children's toy preferences and explored potential biases and factors affecting the results. The bar plots, density plots, and meta-regression analyses are useful tools for assessing the quality and consistency of the findings across different studies.
